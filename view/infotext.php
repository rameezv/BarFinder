Welcome to BarMeUp! BarMeUp serves to show you which bars and clubs are nearby so you don't have to argue with your friends about where to go out until it's already too late to
go out and then the whole NIGHT IS RUINED MELISSA! IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY!
<br /><br />
Sorry about that. BarMeUp also has a handy API for developers that will give them access to the database in JSON format. Developers can simply call /api/clubs to grab a list of all the clubs, bars, and pubs in our database.
You can also request a list of different types of buildings, for example, /api/clubs/Bars for bars. You can also add a club using POST with /api/club. If you have any questions, please contact us through our <a href="support.php">support page</a>.
